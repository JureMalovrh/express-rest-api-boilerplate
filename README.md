# Express REST API boilerplate

## Overview:
The main purpose of this project is to create a boilerplate for an Express APIs. Most of the current boilerplates are way to complicated for a small and easy project. Another thins is that most of them contains both: frontend and backend part, which is not what we want in our case, since all we want is backed. 

## Code structure
TODO


## Note:
This is only a backend code boilerplate, which is organized by a way I think is the most logical. If you are searching for a project that has both frontend and backend part included and is larger and organized, check [Meanjs.org](http://meanjs.org/), which is a great project. In fact a lot of this code has been learned form them.

## TODO:
- [ ] add code (obviously)
- [ ] add task runner (gulp)
- [ ] add tests
- [ ] update readme
- [ ] add dummy starting code
